# Python Practice Exercises

This repository contains a set of Python exercises designed to help you practice fundamental Python programming concepts, from printing messages to creating functions and working with data structures. Each exercise builds upon previous concepts and is divided into sections for focused learning.

## Getting Started

Each exercise is self-contained and can be executed independently. Simply copy the code provided or write your solution for each exercise in a Python file, and run it using Python 3.x.

## Exercises

### Basics

1. **Print a Greeting**  
   Write a Python program to print a greeting message, e.g., `"Hello, Python!"`.

2. **Basic Arithmetic**  
   - Define two variables, `a` and `b`, with numerical values.
   - Print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

3. **String Manipulation**  
   - Define a variable `name` with your name as a value.
   - Print a message saying `"Hello, [name]!"` where `[name]` is the variable's value.

### Lists and Dictionaries

4. **Lists**  
   - Create a list `universities` with at least five university names.
   - Print the entire list and the first and last universities in the list.

5. **Dictionaries**  
   - Create a dictionary `student` with keys `name`, `age`, and `grade`, and assign appropriate values.
   - Print each key-value pair in the dictionary.

### Tuples and Sets

6. **Tuples**  
   - Define a tuple `coordinates` with two values (e.g., representing a point `(x, y)`).
   - Print the tuple and access each element by its index.

7. **Sets**  
   - Create a set `colors` with values `"red"`, `"green"`, and `"blue"`.
   - Add another color to the set, try adding a duplicate color, print the set, remove one color, and merge it with another set `light_colors`.

### Control Flow

8. **Conditional Statements**  
   - Write a program that takes an input number, checks if itâ€™s positive, negative, or zero, and prints a message accordingly.

9. **For Loop**  
   - Create a list of numbers from 1 to 5.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate and print each number.

10. **While Loop**  
    - Write a program that uses a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

11. **Match Statement** (Python 3.10+)
    - Ask the user to input a grade (e.g., "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F").
    - Use a `match` statement to print a message for each grade, and handle invalid input.

### Functions

12. **Define a Function**  
    - Write a function `greet` that takes a name as an argument and prints `"Hello, [name]!"`.
    - Call the function with your own name.

13. **Function with Return Value**  
    - Define a function `square` that returns the square of a number.
    - Print the result of calling this function with different numbers.

14. **Function with Default Parameters**  
    - Write a function `multiply` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, with `b` having a default value of 1.
    - Test the function with and without the second argument.

### Advanced Concepts

15. **List Comprehension**  
    - Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
    - Use list comprehension to create a new list containing the squares of these numbers.

16. **Nested Data Structures**  
    - Create a dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of their grades.
    - Write a function to calculate and print the average grade for each student.

17. **Simple Calculator**  
    - Write a program that defines a `calculate` function to take two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and perform the operation.
    - Ask the user for input, call the function, and print the result.

## How to Use

1. Copy the code for each exercise into a Python script.
2. Run the script using the command:  
   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
